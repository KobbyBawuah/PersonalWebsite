    <h3>Highlight Projects</h3>
    <h4>A few projects which can be viewed in on my Github</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/KobbyBawuah/4thyearapp"> <strong>Cloud Based Circuit Simulator</strong> </a>
        <ul>
        <br>
            <li>Built the front and back‑end of the web application using different programming languages such as HTML, JavaScript and Python.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Constructed the algorithm to evaluate the users input to produce requested variables, graphs and circuit diagrams.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Deployed and optimized the application on the Google App Platform hence giving it the benefits of a cloud‑based application.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Meme Generator</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The goal of this project was to build a "meme generator" – a multimedia 
             application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote from different file types.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Near Earth Objects</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>In this project, I used python to search for and explore close approaches of 
             near-Earth objects (NEOs), using data from NASA/JPL's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Stock portfolios Project</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Created assigned web application that simulated buying and selling stocks. 
             History of all stock trades as well as sessions was also implemented.</li>
        
        <br>
        <li>Built the system using the IEX API in order to access real time stock prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Engineering Project</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Built by using certain skills such as soldering and programming languages to both code the Arduino and GUI’s.</li>
        <br>
            <li>Programmed Arduino nanos to implement an Rf receiver, Transmitter and sensors such as an accelerometer.</li>
        <br>
            <li>3D printed the chassis using CAD Design.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Reverse Engineering Project</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Coordinated a group of colleagues to create a 3D model of a stainless steel 5mm Allen key coming 
            together with a 1/4 inch socket using AUTOCAD and CREO parametric software. 
            The purpose was to create a new and evolved piece with the two tools in one to make it easier and 
            faster to use for drummers to tighten or fix drums.</li>
        </ul>
